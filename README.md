Groovy Scheduler
================

###A class scheduling program used to demonstrate the programming language Groovy.

##Overview:
* Opens a version of the Pacific Lutheran University's J-term 2013 Course Listing.
* Sorts through the file using regular expressions.
* Saves the courses in a data structure and displays the listing to the user.
* Uses a data structure to hold a listing of courses chosen by a user.
* Interfaces with the user, allowing them to view their schedule and add or remove courses.
* Demonstrates overloading of the addition operator.

## Running the program:
1. Download the zip of the program (or just BannerCourses.html and scheduler.groovy to the same folder).
2. Extract files to a folder.
3. You must have Groovy installed for the next step! If you don't have it, follow the instructions [here](http://groovy.codehaus.org).
4. Open a command prompt to the folder containing scheduler.groovy then type in `groovy scheduler.groovy` and hit enter.
5. Enjoy!

*This program was written by Drew Johnson & Jessica Frierson for an assignment in Pacific Lutheran University's CSCE 343 Programming Language Concepts course instructed by Dr. Michael Crocker.
